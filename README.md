# blocktest
testing the connection of my project 
This project explores how different consensus mechanisms—such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)—combined with various cryptographic algorithms like SHA-256, Keccak-256, and ECDSA, impact the security, computational efficiency, and scalability of blockchain networks. The goal is to evaluate and identify optimal design choices for creating secure, performant, and resource-efficient decentralized systems. The work includes building lightweight blockchain prototypes in JavaScript to simulate different consensus protocols and measure key metrics such as block validation time, network throughput, storage overhead, and resistance to common attacks. This repository will document the development of the prototypes, experimental results, analysis scripts, and findings throughout the research process. Contributions and feedback are welcome, and updates will be posted regularly as the project progresses toward the final dissertation submission.
